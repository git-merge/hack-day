# SofaReview

An iPad app for doing code reviews on GitHub repos. The idea is doing code reviews 
in a less formal setting than sitting at your computer.

Currently you can:

* Browse repos
* Highlight areas in files, get the GH link and optionally send it via mail
* Add comment bubbles to files
* Do free form scribbles on files

The later two can only be exported as a screenshot to Camera Roll so far.

The repo can be found here: <https://github.com/neonichu/sofa-review>
